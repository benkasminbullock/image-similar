=head1 NAME

Image::Similar - find out how similar two images are

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% example("synopsis") %]

=head1 VERSION

This documents [% info.colon %] version [% info.version %]
corresponding to git commit L<[% commit.commit %]|[% info.repo
%]/commit/[% commit.commit %]> released on [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an experimental module for comparing images. It uses a
simplified form of the algorithm described in L</An image signature
for any kind of image> to calculate image signatures and distances
between images.

The algorithm consists of converting the image into greyscale,
chopping it into a grid, and then computing a signature based on
relative lightness and darkness of the blocks of the grid.

The module does not contain its own image-reading facility, so images
must be loaded to the module via one of the following supported Perl
modules:

=over

=item L<Imager> (recommended)

All image types are supported. If you have no preference, I suggest
using Imager, since it is a very well-behaved module. The conversion
to greyscale is done using Imager's own routines.

=item L<GD>

All image types are supported. RGB images are combined to greyscale
using constants taken from the source code of L<Imager>.

=item L<Image::Imlib2>

All image types are supported. RGB images are combined to greyscale
using constants taken from the source code of L<Imager>.

=item L<Image::PNG::Libpng>

This module is used for some internals of Image::Similar related to
testing, thus it was installed when you installed
Image::Similar. However, Image::PNG::Libpng is only for PNG images.

Image::Similar supports all PNG image types. It currently only
supports bit depths of eight.

RGB images are combined to greyscale using constants taken from the
source code of L<Imager>. As of this version, there is no handling of
the alpha channel (transparent pixels) and the background value is
ignored.

=back

Use L</load_image> to load the image.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 load_image

Using L<Imager>:

[% INCLUDE "imager.pl" | xtidy %]

Using L<Image::PNG::Libpng>:

[% INCLUDE "libpng.pl" | xtidy %]

The return value is an Image::Similar object.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $is = Image::Similar->new (height => 10, width => 10);

Unless you want to change internals, use L</load_image> instead of
this.

The returned image currently contains a field C<< $is->{image} >>
which you need to use the L</set_pixel> method on to set the pixels.

=head2 diff

    my $diff = $is1->diff ($is2);

This returns a floating-point number which is the difference between
images C<$is1> and C<$is2>. This is meant to be approximately the same
value as given by L<Image::Libpuzzle/vector_euclidean_length()>, but
no validation has been carried out. Both C<$is1> and C<$is2> are
Image::Similar objects created using L</load_image>.

=head2 signature

    my $sig = $is->signature ();

Get the signature of the image. This is a text string
consisting of digits 0-4 which identifies the image.

=head2 sig_diff

    my $diff = $is->sig_diff ($sig);

Get the difference between C<$sig> and the image represented by
C<$is>.

=head2 load_signature

    my $is = load_signature ($sig);

Load C<$is>, an Image::Similar object, from C<$sig>.

=head1 TESTING AND INTERNAL METHODS

This section lists the testing and internal methods of the module, for
people interested in extending or otherwise improving it. Since these
are internal private methods, these are subject to change without
notice.

=head2 write_png

    $is->write_png ('test.png');

This is used in conjunction with L<Image::PNG::Libpng/png_compare>
(version 0.42 or later) to check that Image::Similar has correctly
read in the image, by writing out Image::Similar's internal data as a
PNG file.

=head2 load_image_gd

[% INCLUDE "gd.pl" | xtidy %]

This is the internal routine used by L</load_image> to load L<GD>
images.

=head2 load_image_imlib2

This is the internal routine used by L</load_image> to load
L<Image::Imlib2> images.

=head2 load_image_imager

    my $is = load_image_imager ($imager, %options);

This is the internal routine used by L</load_image> to load L<Imager>
images.  It is not exported. The options are

=over

=item make_grey_png

    my $is = load_image_imager ($imager, make_grey_png => 'imager.png');

Make the greyscale PNG for comparing to Image::Similar's internal
version. See L</write_png> for how to extract Image::Similar's
internal version.

=back

=head2 load_image_libpng

    my $is = load_image_libpng ($libpng);

This loads an image from the return value of
L<Image::PNG::Libpng/read_png_file>.

=head2 Image::Similar::Image methods

These methods work on the XS object within an Image::Similar, which is
called Image::Similar::Image.

=head3 fill_grid

    fill_grid ($img);

Calculate the image's signature and store it within C<$img>. All the
pixel values should have been set with L</set_pixel> before calling
this. This method is called automatically by
L</load_image>. L</load_signature> overrides it with values from the
signature, so this method should only be used when calling L</new>,
filling the pixels by the user, and then making the signature "by
hand" rather than via L</load_image>.

=head3 image_diff

    my $diff = image_diff ($img1, $img2);

This computes the value of L</diff> from the signatures within
C<$img1> and C<$img2>.

=head3 set_pixel

    $img->set_pixel ($x, $y, $grey);

Set a greyscale pixel within the image.  C<$x> and C<$y> need to be
integers, and C<$grey> needs to be an integer between 0-255. Typically
one would first set the width and height of the image with L</new>,
then get the Image::Similar::Image object from the Image::Similar
object, then set its pixels with this method, then compute its
signature with L</fill_grid>.

=head3 get_rows

    my $rows = $img->get_rows ();

Get the greyscale pixels from C<$img> as an array reference C<$rows>
containing strings of bytes, one byte per pixel.

=head3 signature

    my $sig = $image->signature ();

Return the signature value which is set either by L</fill_grid> or
directly by L</fill_from_sig>.

=head3 valid_image

    if ($image->valid_image ()) {
	# do something with image data
    }

This returns a true value only if C<$image> contains valid image
data. This is to distinguish between an image which is loaded from a
stored signature using L</fill_from_sig> and one which is loaded from
an actual image.

=head3 fill_from_sig

    my $image = Image::Similar::Image::fill_from_sig ($sig);

Fill C<$image> using signature data.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Search many files for duplicate images

This script makes a list of all files which may be images:

[% example("find-all-images") %]

This script then gets all the signatures of the images and compares
them looking for similar images.

[% example("make-signatures") %]

=head1 KNOWN PROBLEMS

=head2 Unimplemented parts of the original algorithm

The following parts of the original algorithm are unimplemented as of
this version:

=over

=item Cropping

The 5% and 95% image cropping methods described in the paper are not
used.

=item Soft pixels

The soft pixel method is not used.

=item Histogram of image

There is no balancing of the greyscale of the image using a histogram,
it only uses the raw pixel values.

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

=head2 Other CPAN modules

=over

=item L<Image::Libpuzzle>

This uses a similar algorithm to Image::Similar, but it requires
installing a third-party library called libpuzzle, as well as the gd
library. 

=item L<Image::Seek>

This uses L<ImgSeek|http://www.imgseek.net/> to find similar pictures
in a library. It can load images via L<Imager>, L<Image::Imlib2>, or
L<GD>.
