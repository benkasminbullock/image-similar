=head1 NAME

Image::Similar - find out how similar two images are

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Image::Similar;

=head1 VERSION

This documents version [% version %] of Image::Similar corresponding to git
commit [% commit.commit %] released on [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an experimental module for comparing images. It uses a
simplified form of the algorithm described in L</An image signature
for any kind of image> to calculate image signatures and distances
between images.

The module does not contain its own image-reading facility, so images
must be loaded to the module via one of the following supported Perl
modules:

=over

=item L<Imager>

All image types are supported.

=item L<Image::PNG::Libpng>

Image::Similar currently supports GRAY, GRAY_ALPHA, RGB, and RGBA
C<Image::PNG::Libpng> image types, but not paletted image types. It
only supports bit depths of eight.

RGB images are combined to greyscale using constants taken from the
source code of L<Imager>. As of this version, there is no handling of
the alpha channel (transparent pixels) and the background value is
ignored.

=back

Use L</load_image> to load the image.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 load_image

Using L<Imager>:

[% INCLUDE "imager.pl" | xtidy %]

Using L<Image::PNG::Libpng>:

[% INCLUDE "libpng.pl" | xtidy %]

The return value is an Image::Similar object.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $is = Image::Similar->new (height => 10, width => 10);

Unless you want to change internals, use L</load_image> instead of
this.

The returned image currently contains a field C<< $is->{image} >>
which you need to use the L</set_pixel> method on to set the pixels.

=head2 diff

    my $diff = $is1->diff ($is2);

This returns a floating-point number which is the difference between
images C<$is1> and C<$is2>. This is meant to be approximately the same
value as given by L<Image::Libpuzzle/vector_euclidean_length()>, but
no validation has been carried out yet.

=head2 signature

    my $sig = $is->signature ();

Get the signature of the image. This is currently a text string
consisting of digits 0-4 which identifies the image. This is liable to
change with future versions of the module.

=head2 sig_diff

    my $diff = $is->sig_diff ($sig);

Get the difference between C<$sig> and the image represented by
C<$is>.

=head2 load_signature

    my $is = load_signature ($sig);

Load C<$is>, an Image::Similar object, from C<$sig>.

=head1 TESTING AND INTERNAL METHODS

This section lists the testing and internal methods of the module, for
people interested in extending or otherwise improving it. Since these
are internal private methods, these are subject to change without
notice.

=head2 write_png

    $is->write_png ('test.png');

This is used in conjunction with L<Image::PNG::Libpng/png_compare>
(version 0.42 or later) to check that Image::Similar has correctly
read in the image, by writing out Image::Similar's internal data as a
PNG file.

=head2 load_image_imager

    my $is = load_image_imager ($imager, %options);

This is the internal routine used by L</load_image> to load L<Imager>
images. The options are

=over

=item make_grey_png

    my $is = load_image_imager ($imager, make_grey_png => 'imager.png');

Make the greyscale PNG for comparing to Image::Similar's internal
version. See L</write_png> for details.

=back

=head2 load_image_libpng

    my $is = load_image_libpng ($libpng);

This loads an image from the return value of
L<Image::PNG::Libpng/read_png_file>.

=head2 INTERNAL Image::Similar::Image METHODS

These methods work on the XS object within an Image::Similar, which is
called Image::Similar::Image.

=head3 fill_grid

    fill_grid ($img);

Calculate the image's signature and store it within C<$img>.

=head3 image_diff

    my $diff = image_diff ($img1, $img2);

Compute the value for L</diff>.

=head3 set_pixel

    $img->set_pixel ($x, $y, $grey);

C<$x> and C<$y> need to be integers, and C<$grey> needs to be an
integer within 0-255.

=head3 get_rows

    my $rows = $img->get_rows ();

Get the greyscale pixels from C<$img> as an array reference C<$rows>
containing strings of bytes, one byte per pixel.

=head3 signature

    my $sig = $image->signature ();

=head1 KNOWN PROBLEMS

=head2 Unimplemented parts of the original algorithm

The following parts of the original algorithm are unimplemented as of
this version:

=over

=item Cropping

The 5% and 95% image cropping methods described in the paper are not
used.

=item Soft pixels

The soft pixel method is not used.

=item Histogram of image

There is no balancing of the greyscale of the image using a histogram,
it only uses the raw pixel values.

=back

=head2 Other CPAN modules

=over

=item L<Image::Libpuzzle>

This uses a similar algorithm to Image::Similar, but it requires
installing a third-party library called libpuzzle, as well as the gd
library.
